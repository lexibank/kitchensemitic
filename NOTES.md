## Notes on the Comparison with Original Sources (B. Sapirstein)

Unable to identify original sources for Mɛhri, Jibbali, and Harsusi.

Kitchen et al say:

> Wordlists for the Ethiosemitic languages (Amharic, Argobba, Chaha, Gafat, Ge’ez, Geto,
> Harari, Innemor, Mesmes, Mesqan, Soddo, Tigre, Tigrinya, Walani and Zway) and Ogaden Arabic
> were drawn from Bender (1971). Wordlists for Moroccan Arabic, South Arabian languages (
> Jibbali, Harsusi, Mehri and Soqotri) and extinct non-African Semitic languages (Akkadian,
> Biblical Aramaic, ancient Hebrew and Ugaritic) were constructed from previously published
> lexicons (Leslau 1938; Gelb et al. 1956; Sobelman & Harrel 1963; Rabin 1975).

I can't see these three in Leslau, Gelb, Sobelman & Harrel or Rabin or Bender.
